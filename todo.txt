Things to do:

	Aircraft:
		Rainbow smoketrail to indicate health (smoketrail with a rainbow background most likely, maybe have the rainbow change colors on health)
		Make object prototype

	Add more crafts, including but not limited to
		Tanks (medium accuracy and high damage),
		Helicopters (highly accurate but lesser damage),
		Drones (unmanned airial vehicles),
		Surface to Air missles (most likely a truck that rolls in and starts firing)

	Local two player:
		Split screens if players get to far appart (that way we allow a large map, include pointers to the other players)

	Game modes:
		Single player:
			Survival (bunch of enemies),
			Waves (enemies spawn in waves)

		Local two player:
			Duel (no enemies, players fight eachother),
			Survival (bunch of enemies, same as single player)

	Music:
		Get Au√∞unn to play some ambient bass
